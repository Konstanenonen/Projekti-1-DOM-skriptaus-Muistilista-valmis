I made a to-do list using vanilla javascript and very basic html and css. User can add things to the list and mark them done or undone. There is a button to show only
done list items and another button to show undone list items. There is also a button to show both done and undone list items. There is also a button to clear the list.
at the bottom there is also a a count of how many undone list items are left. This to-do list uses browsers localstorage so the list will stay the same after browser
refresh and restart.
